githubcutter
============

A tool to setup GitHub repositories using simple YAML templates.

The tool was inspired by cookiecutter_, which is heavily used in the lab,
as we needed a tool to automate repositories creation on GitHub.

Githubcutter is the result of a quick weekend of coding,
which means that more functions might probably needed and
that bugs are hanging around.
